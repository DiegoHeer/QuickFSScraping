Description: QuickFS Scraping
        ============================
        
        This project should be used as a tool to gather
        financial data from us market traded equities. The
        main source for scraping the data is a site called
        [QuickFS](https://quickfs.net/).
        
        An account is necessary, and API keys should be 
        retrieved for API scraping and one for web scraping.
        Be aware that excessive web scraping can cause
        being blocked from QuickFS. Also know that the free
        membership has a limited amount of quotes. Excessive
        api scraping can result in exceeding the daily quota.
